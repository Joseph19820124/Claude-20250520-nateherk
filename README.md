- **Data Acquisition & ETL**: Collecting, extracting, transforming, and loading data
- **Data Understanding & EDA**: Exploratory data analysis to understand patterns
- **Data Visualization**: Creating visual representations of data insights
- **Feature Engineering**: Selecting and transforming features for modeling
- **Model Creation, Training & Validation**: Building and validating ML models
- **Model Deployment**: Implementing models in production environments
- **Model Monitoring**: Ongoing tracking of model performance
- **Data Drift Analysis**: Detecting changes in data patterns over time
- **Model Drift Analysis**: Identifying degradation in model performance
- **Dashboard, Reports & Scores**: Creating visualizations of results

This cycle is iterative, with feedback loops for model recalibration and feature updates as needed.
